        ====================================================
        EXTENDED PROJECT REPORTS & TECHNICAL RESULTS
        ====================================================

        PROJECT 1: Power Generation with Footsteps of Stairs and Biometric Security (Dec 2024)
        - Mechanical Design: Developed a spring-mass system (k = 19620 N/m) coupled with a double-acting hydraulic piston-cylinder. The kinetic energy compresses the piston, driving hydraulic fluid through a micro-turbine coupled to a 12V DC Generator. Modeled in SolidWorks.
        - Biometric Data Collection: Used vibration and multi-dimensional (X,Y,Z) acceleration sensors to capture unique human gait dynamics.
        - Machine Learning: Built a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Artificial Neural Network using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras. Features (time per step, XYZ acceleration) are fed into dense hidden layers (ReLU activation) and a Softmax output layer for multi-class classification (using adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss) to accurately identify individuals.
        - Software/Cloud: Developed a Flutter (Dart) mobile application integrated with Firebase Cloud Storage for real-time biometric prediction and data visualization.

        PROJECT 2: Measuring ECG through Defibrillation Electrodes
        - Problem: Defibrillation pulses (up to 5 kV, 50 A) saturate conventional ECG amplifiers, creating a "blind period". 
        - Hardware Protection: Designed a 3-stage front-end compliant with IEC 60601-2-4. Used 10 kΩ current-limiting resistors, TVS diodes for clamping, and a MOSFET-based baseline restoration circuit to rapidly discharge capacitors. Used an Instrumentation Amplifier with CMRR ≥ 110 dB and Right Leg Drive (RLD).
        - Digital Signal Processing (DSP): Applied Adaptive Filtering (LMS, NLMS, RLS) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) denoising (Daubechies-4 at level 8). Achieved a cumulative Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) improvement of 40-65 dB with < 100 ms latency.
        - AI & Sensors: Evaluated hybrid CNN-LSTM deep learning architectures for real-time cardiac rhythm classification. Proposed a multifunctional defibrillation electrode integrating temperature, SpO2, and ECG sensors, isolated via heat-dissipating fiber textiles.

        PROJECT 3: Low Velocity Wind Energy Harvesting for Power Generation Using Vibration
        - Aerodynamics: Engineered a dual-body Vortex-Induced Vibration (VIV) system. Primary body: NACA 0012 airfoil. Secondary body: Cylinder placed in the turbulent wake.
        - CFD Analysis: Used ANSYS Fluent (k-ω SST turbulence model) to optimize wake characteristics. At 3 m/s, the NACA 0012 airfoil exhibited a Strouhal Number of 0.20 and a shedding frequency of 1.00 Hz.
        - Power Generation: Designed a Permanent Magnet Linear Induction Generator (PMLIG) using N52-grade NdFeB magnets (1.42 T remanent flux).
        - Results: Reached resonance at 11 m/s wind speed (2.19 Hz). The primary airfoil generated 50 W, and the secondary cylinder generated 37.5 W, yielding a combined peak power of 87.5 W. The addition of the secondary cylinder increased total power output by ~75%. Achieved a peak system efficiency of 7.32% at 7 m/s.

        PROJECT 4: Design and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of a Double Wishbone Suspension System
        - Design: 3D modeled a suspension assembly inspired by the Audi A4 B8 sedan (multi-link SLA architecture) with an upper control arm (250mm) and lower arm (350mm).
        - Static Structural Analysis: Conducted in ANSYS Mechanical on structural steel. Maximum applied loads included a 1000.6 N vertical load, 680 N centripetal force, and 1400.9 N cornering force.
        - Results: Maximum von Mises stress was only 18.329 MPa (far below the 250 MPa yield strength). Maximum total deformation was a negligible 0.059 mm.
        - Safety & NVH: Achieved an incredibly high Factor of Safety (13.64), proving a highly conservative design. Modal analysis revealed a 1st natural frequency of 399.39 Hz, providing a 13x safety margin over maximum road excitation (30 Hz) and ensuring zero resonance risk.

        PROJECT 5: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Analysis of an Air and Dirt Separator
        - Setup: Steady-state multiphase CFD simulation in ANSYS Fluent (k-ω SST turbulence model) for an inline separator (508 mm body ID) evaluated at 900, 1100, and 1300 GPM at 50 PSI.
        - Pressure Drop: Measured ∆P of 0.373 PSI (900 GPM), 0.612 PSI (1100 GPM), and 0.795 PSI (1300 GPM). Numerically validated using calculated K-factors (0.78, 0.86, and 0.80). Maximum internal velocity reached 6.665 m/s at the nozzle constriction.
        - Separation Efficiency (Discrete Phase Model): 
          - Dirt (100 µm particles): Achieved near-perfect separation (96.05% at 900 GPM, 99.98% at 1100 GPM, 99.83% at 1300 GPM).
          - Air Bubbles: Highly size-dependent. 100 µm bubbles achieved >95% separation across all flow rates due to buoyancy dominance. 50 µm bubbles showed flow-rate sensitivity (17.2% at 1100 GPM), while 20 µm micro-bubbles were fully entrained in the vortex (0% separation).

        SKILLS:
        - Engineering Software: CAD (SolidWorks, AutoCAD), ANSYS (Fluent, Mechanical), MATLAB.
        - Software & AI: Python, Dart, Flutter, TensorFlow, Keras, Firebase, Git.
        - Core Engineering: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Finite Element Analysis (FEA), Digital Signal Processing (DSP), Control Systems (PLC).
